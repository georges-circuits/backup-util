## Install

tested on python 3.10, should work with 3.7 and above

### install required dependencies
- python3-tkinter
- rsync (possible to create a class wrapping a different program)

### run `install.py`
execute `python3 install.py` in the project root directory. This will ask some questions, defaults should be fine, it will then create a systemd service file to autostart the utility after system startup
